Use Case 3: Search for Freelancers Based on Criteria


Actor: User, Freelancer, Employer
Pre-condition: None

Description:
	Users can search for freelancers using filters such as name and skill. 
	The system performs a case-insensitive search and displays freelancers that match the input string(s). 
	Users can enter a name, a skill, or both.

Basic Flow:
	The user navigates to the search interface.
	The user can enter:
	A name in the name search box, and/or
	A skill in the skill text box.
	The system performs the following logic:
	If a name is entered: 
		shows freelancers whose names contain the entered string (case-insensitive).
	If a skill is entered: 
		shows freelancers who have at least one skill that contains the entered string (case-insensitive).
	If both fields are filled: 
		only shows freelancers who match both conditions.
	The user can view matching freelancer profiles or refine their search.

Alternative Flow â€“ No Matches:
	The system displays no freelancers

Post-condition: The user sees a list of freelancers who match the entered name and/or skill criteria.

Actor: User, Freelancer, Employer

Description:
	Users can search for freelancers using filters such as name and skill. 
	The system performs a case-insensitive search and displays freelancers that match the name string,
	and matches any of the selected skills.
	Users can enter a name, skill(s), or both.

Basic Flow:

		b. If skills are selected:
			-Show freelancers who have any of the skills selected.
		c. If both are entered:
			-Only show freelancers whose name contains the string and freelancer who has at least one of the selected skills.
	7. The system displays a list of freelancers who match the criteria.
	8. The user may select a freelancers profile to view more details or choose to refine their search (return to Step 4).

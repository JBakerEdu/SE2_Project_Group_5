Use Case: Edit Freelancer Account Information

Actor: Freelancer 
Pre-condition: The user is logged in as a freelancer account.

Description:
A freelancer can update their profile details such as skills, bio, and category. Completing this information finalizes their freelancer profile and places them in the appropriate category listing.

Basic Flow – Edit Freelancer Profile
  1. The user accesses the freelancer profile edit page.
  2. The user enters or updates their skills.
  3. The user writes or updates their freelancer bio.
  4. The user selects an existing category from a dropdown.
  5. The user clicks the "Save" button.
  6. The system validates the input and saves the updated profile.
  7. The system assigns the user to the selected category.
  8. The updated profile is shown in search results and within the new category listing.
  9. Employers can now view the complete profile and "Hyre" the freelancer.

Alternative Flow 4.A – Create New Category
  4A. Instead of selecting a category, the user enters a new personal category name.
  4B. The system creates the new category.
  4C. The user is assigned as the first freelancer in that category.
  4D. Continue to Step 5.

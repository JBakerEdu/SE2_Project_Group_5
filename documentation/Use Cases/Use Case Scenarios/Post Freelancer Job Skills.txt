Use Case 5: Post Freelancer Job Skills


Actor: Freelancer
Pre-condition: The freelancer is logged in.

Description:
	Freelancers can manage their profiles by updating job skills, writing or editing their bio, and managing their category placement. 
	They can select from existing categories or create a new one if needed. 
	Additionally, freelancers have the option to delete their account entirely.

Basic Flow:
	The freelancer navigates to their account/profile page.
	The freelancer clicks the "Edit" button.
	Updates or adds job skills.
	Writes or edits their bio.
	Selects an existing category or enters a personal category.
	If a personal category is entered:
		The system creates the category and assigns the freelancer as the first member.
	The freelancer clicks "Save."
	The system updates the freelancer’s profile with the new information.

Additional Flow – Delete Account:
	The freelancer clicks the "Delete Account" option in settings.
	Upon confirmation, the system permanently deletes the freelancer’s account and associated data.

Alternative Flows:
	Unconfirmed Deletion: If the freelancer cancels the confirmation prompt, no data is deleted.

Post-condition: The freelancer’s profile is updated with new or modified skills, bio, and category — or the account is successfully deleted, depending on the action taken.

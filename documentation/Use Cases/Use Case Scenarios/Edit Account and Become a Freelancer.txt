Use Case 8: Edit Account and Become a Freelancer

Actor: User (Basic Account)
Pre-condition: The user is logged in with a basic account (non-freelancer).

Description:
A basic user can update their account bio and choose to become a freelancer. Once they opt to become a freelancer, the system updates their role and reveals additional profile fields for them to complete, including skills and category selection. Upon completion, the user is publicly visible in the selected category and can be "Hyred" by employers.

Use Case 9: Sign In to Existing Account


Actor: User (Freelancer or Employer)
Pre-condition: The user already has an account registered on the platform.

Description:
	A user can sign into their existing account through the sign-in page. 
	If the credentials are valid, the system retrieves their account data and grants them access to the platform. 
	If authentication fails, the user is notified and asked to try again.

Basic Flow:
	The user navigates to the Sign In page.
	The user enters their username/email and password.
	The user clicks "Sign In."
	The system verifies the credentials:
	If valid:
		The system retrieves the user’s account data (profile info, settings, messages, etc.).
		The user is redirected to the main platform dashboard and can begin using the program.
	If invalid:
		The system displays an error message such as "Incorrect username or password. Please try again."

Alternative Flow – Authentication Failure:
	The system allows multiple retry attempts.

Post-condition: The user is either signed into the platform and granted access, or informed that login failed and prompted to retry.
